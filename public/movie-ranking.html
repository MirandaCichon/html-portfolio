<h1>Miranda's Top Three Favourite Movies</h1>
<h2>The movies I just can't stop watching</h2>
<hr /> 
<h3>Moulin Rouge</h3>
<p>Freedom, beauty, truth and love! What more could anyone ask for but a beautiful romance between a penniless writer and a courtesan. Plus, the eye-catching direction of Baz Lurman and some incredible musical hits. </p>
<h3>John Wick</h3>
<p>Spoiler Alert!!...His dog is murdered and he goes on an epic mission to get revenge. I can never get enough of this unique story and the action it contains. The best action movie of all time!</p>
<h3>Shrek</h3>
<p>This is the perfect movie to watch when you are sick, depressed, or needing a tight warm hug. Great sounds, amazing characters, brilliant humour and a storyline like no other... and yet, like many others. A classic! </p>
