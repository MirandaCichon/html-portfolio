<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a Web Developer beginning my joyful journey through HTML, enjoying life while feeling JavaScript looming 
 in the background. This webpage page was developed as part of a Udemy course: The Complete Web Development Bootcamp, led by 
Dr. Angela Yu. </p>

<p>As a former teacher, I have many technical skills to learn on my journey, but feel the soft
  skills I have learned so far in my career will continue to support me as I transition into Web Development. 
</p>

<p>Feel free to reach out if you are seeking support, a coding buddy, or have any advice you would like to offer. 
I feel that coding is always best done in public and with people.
